									<p style="font-size:20px; color:black">My research focuses on understanding the cognitive components of wayfinding behavior in people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Wayfinding is an umbrella term that includes a wide range of abilities and behaviors, such as memory for the location of landmarks, following a specific route, and knowledge relating to the spatial layout of an environment.</p>
									<p style="font-size:20px; color:black">Ultimately, I hope that my research can positively impact the lives of people with disabilities. Navigational deficits prevent independent living. However, I have also begun to explore other barriers to independent living in the intellectual disability community. For instance, I have been exploring how individual differences in attitudes towards people with intellectual disability create barriers to inclusion. The preliminary findings on this study have been very exciting, and I look forward to continuing my research in this area.</p>
									<p style="font-size:20px; color:black">My interest in statistics has led me to work on a wide range of projects. I maintain collaborations with researchers at several institutions and often provide statistical support. This has been a rewarding experience that I hope continues throughout my career. </p>
									<p style="font-size:20px; color:black">I take pride in providing research mentorship to help students meet their academic and career goals. I include undergraduate students in my research program and mentor them on independent projects. This gives undergraduate students research opportunities that are typically not available until graduate school. I hold students to a high standard and emphasize the development of professional skills. Students that have worked in my lab have gone on to graduate school in a range of programs.</p>

									<h3>Wayfinding in People with Down syndrome</h3>
									<p>People with Down syndrome (DS) often exhibit deficiencies in wayfinding activities, particularly route learning. Evidence concerning more sophisticated survey learning has been sparse. We conducted two experiments that evaluated survey learning of youth with DS and typically developing children (TD) matched on mental age. In Experiment 1, the participants with DS performed comparably to TD participants matched on non-verbal ability on all of our measures of survey learning. Hence, we concluded that people with DS can acquire some survey knowledge when tasked with learning a small environment and given the opportunity to do so. In Experiment 2, the participants with DS exhibited significantly less skill at identifying a shortcut than did the TD participants, with differences emerging as the number of exposures increased. Participants with DS were also less able to recall landmarks at the end of the experiment. Overall, however, the performance of both groups was relatively poor in both experiments â€“ with the performance of participants with DS being worse as conditions became less optimal. These results were discussed in terms of underlying mechanisms that may account for variations in survey learning as environmental complexity increases.</p>

									<h3>I Can See Myself Helping</h3>
									<p>Many studies indicate that increasing self-awareness leads to individuals reflecting on their values and ideals. This self-reflection appears to increase prosocial behavior. However, previously studies typically manipulated self-awareness in situations in which the individual may have felt pressure from the researcher to help. We used a novel experimental paradigm to manipulate self-awareness and remove the researcher's presence to decrease the likelihood that the participant would conform to experimenter demand. The results indicated a strong probability that the experimental condition participants were more prosocial than control condition participants. These findings provide additional support for the hypothesis that self-reflection increases prosocial behavior, even without experimenter demands. These findings and the importance of studying objective self-awareness in light of the coronavirus are discussed.</p>
