									<p style="font-size:20px; color:black">My current research focuses on how the educational environment can support faculty and student well-being and protect against burnout. I am particularly interested in how we can build learning environment that help close equity gaps for students from historically marginalized backgrounds, such as Black, Latino, or indigenous students or first-generation students. In the long term, I am excited to extend this work to better understand the experience of students with disabilities.</p>
									<p style="font-size:20px; color:black">Most recently, my research has examined how learning mindsets in medical education influence student well-being and resilience, particularly in the face of widespread burnout and mental health challenges within the healthcare profession. By exploring concepts such as growth mindset, purpose, and belonging, my work aims to understand how these psychological factors shape medical students’ experiences and support a healthier, more sustainable approach to medical education. Focusing on both individual beliefs and perceptions of the learning environment, this research underscores the importance of systemic educational changes that foster motivation, connection, and support for all students, with particular benefits for those from historically marginalized backgrounds. Ultimately, my goal is to contribute to the development of mindset-supportive pedagogies that equip medical students with the resilience and well-being needed for a fulfilling career in medicine.</p>
									<p style="font-size:20px; color:black">I also maintain active collaborations with researchers at several institutions. My role is often in supporting the planning, design, and analysis of psychological studies. This has been a rewarding experience because it allows me to explore a wide range of projects. Further, I get to build and maintain meaningful relationships with scholars and friends. I hope to continue this work throughout my career. </p>

									<h3>How Can a Growth Mindset-Supportive Learning Environment in Medical School Promote Student Well-Being?</h3>
									<p>Burnout among physicians and medical students is a growing concern, highlighting the need to improve student well-being during their medical education. In this study, we found that growth mindset–––the belief that ability can be developed–––and students’ perceptions of their instructors’ growth mindset were significant predictors of well-being, with the strongest effects observed in students from historically marginalized backgrounds. These findings suggest that fostering growth mindset-supportive learning environments in medical education could play a crucial role in reducing burnout and preparing students for healthier, more sustainable careers.</p>

									<h3>Learning Mindsets and Well-Being and Ill-Being Among Osteopathic Medical Students</h3>
									<p>Burnout and mental health challenges among medical students highlight the urgent need for strategies to support their well-being, especially in light of projected physician shortages. This study analyzed data from first-year osteopathic medical students, finding that learning mindsets, such as growth mindset, purpose and relevance, and sense of belonging, were significantly associated with well-being (e.g., flourishing) and ill-being (e.g., burnout), with stronger effects for historically marginalized students. These findings suggest that fostering supportive learning mindsets may be a promising approach to improving medical student health and reducing burnout.</p>
