										</header>
										<p style="font-size:18px; color:black">
											Education has the power to transform our lives by opening us up to new knowledge, skills, and perspectives. However, the path to attaining a college degree is filled with individual and structural barriers. My professional mission is to understand these challenges and develop systemic, institutional change to help college students persist and achieve their educational goals.  
											<p>

										<p style="font-size:18px; color:black">
											In my previous role as a professor of psychology at <a href="maryvillecollege.edu">Maryville College</a>, a small liberal arts college, I taught a wide range of students. I tried to share with students my excitement for the subject, build a strong sense of belonging, and demonstrate my own commitment to being a lifelong learner. Over time, I noticed that many of my students and colleagues were burned out and struggling with their mental health and well-being. I decided to transition my career to focus on researching and developing strategies to address these challenges. 
											<p>
												
										<p style="font-size:18px; color:black">
											In my current role as the Lead Data Science Manager at <a href="motivatelab.org">Motivate Lab</a>, I am committed to advancing the knowledge and skills of educators, ensuring they stay at the forefront of pedagogical practices through evidence-based insights. At the heart of my responsibilities is leveraging my statistical and research skills to drive professional development for college faculty.
											<p>

										<p style="font-size:18px; color:black">
											There is a saying in improvement science: "Every system is perfectly designed to get the results it gets." During my teaching career, I realized that approach to supporting students was primarily indivudal: I saw a student struggle and tried to address that student's needs. I now appreciate the power of systems thinkig. By building educational systems that promote student (and faculty) well-being, we can prevent some of the barriers from happening in the first place. To use a metaphor, attaining a college degree is like a road filled with potholes. Rather than build stronger tires, I want to pave the road.

										<h3 style="font-size:22px; color:black">About Me</h3>
									</header>

										<p style="font-size:18px; color:black">
											I received my MA and PhD in Experimental Psychology from The University of Alabama and my BA in Psychology from Rivier College (a small liberal arts college in New Hampshire). My educational experiences have shaped my belief in the transformative power of education, the importance of continued professional development, and the benefit of learning from those with a different experience than your own.
											<p>

										<p style="font-size:18px; color:black">
											I am often found spending time with loved ones, exploring a new city, cooking, or feeding my caffeine addiction at a local coffee shop. I am a reluctant runner, an avid (but not very strong) chess player, and love to learn new things.
