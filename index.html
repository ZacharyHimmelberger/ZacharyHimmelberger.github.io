										</header>
										<p style="font-size:18px; color:black">
											Education has the power to transform our lives by opening us up to new knowledge, skills, and perspectives. However, the path to attaining a college degree is filled with individual and structural barriers. My professional mission is to understand these challenges and develop systemic, institutional change to help college students persist and achieve their educational goals.  
											<p>

										<p style="font-size:18px; color:black">
											In my previous role as a professor of psychology at <a href="maryvillecollege.edu">Maryville College</a>, a small liberal arts college, I taught a wide range of students. I tried to share with students my excitement for the subject, build a strong sense of belonging, and demonstrate my own commitment to being a lifelong learner. Over time, I noticed that many of my students and colleagues were burned out and struggling with their mental health and well-being. I decided to transition my career to focus on researching and developing strategies to address these challenges. 
											<p>
												
										<p style="font-size:18px; color:black">
											In my current role as the Lead Data Science Manager at <a href="motivatelab.org">Motivate Lab</a>, I am committed to advancing the knowledge and skills of educators, ensuring they stay at the forefront of pedagogical practices through evidence-based insights. At the heart of my responsibilities is leveraging my statistical and research skills to drive professional development for college faculty.
											<p>

										<p style="font-size:18px; color:black">
											There is a saying in improvement science: "Every system is perfectly designed to get the results it gets." During my teaching career, I realized that approach to supporting students was primarily indivudal: I saw a student struggle and tried to address that student's needs. I now appreciate the power of systems thinkig. By building educational systems that promote student (and faculty) well-being, we can prevent some of the barriers from happening in the first place. To use a metaphor, attaining a college degree is like a road filled with potholes. Rather than build stronger tires, I want to pave the road.

										<h3 style="font-size:22px; color:black">About Me</h3>
									</header>

										<p style="font-size:18px; color:black">
											I received my MA and PhD in Experimental Psychology from The University of Alabama and my BA in Psychology from Rivier College (a small liberal arts college in New Hampshire). My educational experiences have shaped my belief in the transformative power of education, the importance of continued professional development, and the benefit of learning from those with a different experience than your own.
											<p>

										<p style="font-size:18px; color:black">
											I am often found spending time with loved ones, exploring a new city, cooking, or feeding my caffeine addiction at a local coffee shop. I am a reluctant runner, an avid (but not very strong) chess player, and love to learn new things.

											<h3>Image Classification for Technical Indicators</h3>
											<p>We created a sample of financial time-series images (candlestick charts and line graphs) and developed a machine learning image classification algorithm to identify previously labeled technical indicators (e.g., RSI). This project is an open-source version of a previous study published by researchers at a large financial institution.</p>

											<h3>Longitudinal Data Analysis Workshop</h3>
											<p>In this workshop presented at the Southeastern Psychological Association in 2021, we present a conceptual and mathematical introduction to multilevel modeling with a specific focus on longitudinal research designs. The presentation was recorded, but we also show the R scripts used to create the presentaiton material and made the presentaiton slides available.</p>

											<h3>Bayesian Course Final Project</h3>
											<p>In 2021, I had the the opportunity to take an online course in Bayesian Data Analysis offered by Aki Vehtari. This course was designed to help researchers and applied statisticians understand how to better use Bayesian models in their own work. All of the course materials can be found <a href="https://avehtari.github.io/BDA_course_Aalto/gsu2021.html" <span class="label">here</span></a>.</p>

											<h3>Bayesian Analysis of a Simple Experiment</h3>
											<p>In this simple experiment, we developed a novel experimental paradigm to manipulate self-awareness. A Bayesian model indicated a strong probability that participants were more prosocial when their self-awareness was increased. The full paper can be accessed <a href="uploads/Lewis et al. (2020) I can see myself helping.pdf" <span class="label">here</span></a></p>
