											<h3 style="font-size:22px; color:black">What I do</h3>
										</header>
										<p style="font-size:18px; color:black"> In my role as the Lead Data Science Manager at <a href="motivatelab.org">Motivate Lab</a>, an educational research lab, I sit at the intersection of academia and industry, publishing in peer-reviewed, scientific journals and making data-driven decisions to promote our mission of improving people's lives through rigorous motivation research.<p>

										<p style="font-size:18px; color:black">At the heart of my responsibilities is driving professional development for college faculty. I am committed to advancing the knowledge and skills of educators, ensuring they stay at the forefront of pedagogical practices through evidence-based insights derived from our research. Leveraging my statistical training and previous experience as a faculty member at a small liberal arts college, I bring a unique perspective to my work.<p>

										<p style="font-size:18px; color:black">In a previous role, I served as Assistant Professor of Psychology in Developmental and Experimental Research at <a href="maryvillecollege.edu">Maryville College</a>, where I taught courses in statistics, research methodology, and developmental psychology. As a teacher, I take pride in my ability to teach complex statistical and research skills by combining conceptual, visual, and mathematical explanations, and I always tried to share with students my excitement and commitment to being a lifelong learner.<p>

									<header>
										<h3 style="font-size:22px; color:black">Expertise</h3>
									</header>
										<p style="font-size:18px; color:black">I have worked with a range of statistical modeling techniques: linear models, generalized linear models, hierarchical models, path analysis, latent variable models, and time series analysis. I am most comfortable working in Python and R, though I have also worked with other programming languages, including JavaScript, SPSS, Stan, and SAS.<p>

										<p style="font-size:18px; color:black">I am a Bayesian at heart, though I spend considerable time working in a frequentist framework. Recently, I have been studying and using various machine learning algorithms to expand my statistical repertoire.<p>

										<!-- <header>
											<h3 style="font-size:22px; color:black">Who I am</h3>
										</header>
										<p style="font-size:18px; color:black">You can find me spending time with my wife, having long conversations with our cats, cooking, or feeding my caffeine addiction at a local coffee shop. I am a reluctant runner, an avid (but not very strong) chess player, and am obsessed with learning new things.</p> -->

										<header>
											<h3 style="font-size:22px; color:black">Academic Background</h3>
										</header>
										<p style="font-size:18px; color:black">I received my MA and PhD in Experimental Psychology from The University of Alabama and my BA in Psychology from Rivier College (a small liberal arts college in New Hampshire). My educational experiences have shaped my belief in the transformative power of education, the importance of continued professional development, and the benefit of learning from those with a different experience than your own.</p>

											<h3>Image Classification for Technical Indicators</h3>
											<p>We created a sample of financial time-series images (candlestick charts and line graphs) and developed a machine learning image classification algorithm to identify previously labeled technical indicators (e.g., RSI). This project is an open-source version of a previous study published by researchers at a large financial institution.</p>

											<h3>Longitudinal Data Analysis Workshop</h3>
											<p>In this workshop presented at the Southeastern Psychological Association in 2021, we present a conceptual and mathematical introduction to multilevel modeling with a specific focus on longitudinal research designs. The presentation was recorded, but we also show the R scripts used to create the presentaiton material and made the presentaiton slides available.</p>

											<h3>Bayesian Course Final Project</h3>
											<p>In 2021, I had the the opportunity to take an online course in Bayesian Data Analysis offered by Aki Vehtari. This course was designed to help researchers and applied statisticians understand how to better use Bayesian models in their own work. All of the course materials can be found <a href="https://avehtari.github.io/BDA_course_Aalto/gsu2021.html" <span class="label">here</span></a>.</p>

											<h3>Bayesian Analysis of a Simple Experiment</h3>
											<p>In this simple experiment, we developed a novel experimental paradigm to manipulate self-awareness. A Bayesian model indicated a strong probability that participants were more prosocial when their self-awareness was increased. The full paper can be accessed <a href="uploads/Lewis et al. (2020) I can see myself helping.pdf" <span class="label">here</span></a></p>
