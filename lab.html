										<h1>Cognitive Science Laboratory</h1>
									</header>
									
									<p style="font-size:20px; color:black">Students in the Cognitive Science Lab serve as research assistants on a wide range of projects, 
										including cognitive and social psychological research, data analytic consulting for campus and 
										community organizations, and peer tutoring. In previous semesters, students have:</p>
										<ul style="font-size:20px; color:black">
											<li>Submitted original research for publication in peer-reviewed journals</li>
											<li>Written IRB applications and conducted ethical training</li>
											<li>Written safety procedures for behavioral experiments during COVID</li>
											<li>Analyzed data using R and SPSS</li>
											<li>Provided statistical support to campus programs</li>
											<li>Tutored peers and served as teaching assistants</li>
											<li>Presented research at professional conferences</li>
										</ul>
									<p style="font-size:20px; color:black">Because Maryville College does not have a graduate program in psychology, research assistants 
										are expected to take on responsibilities that are more typical of a graduate student. They 
										gain hands-on research experience that prepares them to thrive in graduate school. I expect 
										all students in the lab to leave with the following skills and experiences:</p>
										<ul style="font-size:20px; color:black">
											<li>Proficiency in R</li>
											<li>Ability to read and evaluate peer-reviewed empirical research</li>
											<li>Present their work at a professional conference</li>
											<li>Recruit participants and collect behavioral data</li>
											<li>Tutor peers in R programming, statistics, scientific writing, and APA formatting</li>
										</ul>

										<h3>Jay Barrow (jay.barrow@my.maryvillecollege.edu)</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Research Interests: Psychoanalytic, psychodynamic, unheimliech, uncanniness, prosocial behavior, masking, nosology, nosological critique</p>
									<p>My program of study at Maryville College focuses on the intersection of psychodynamic and existential therapy with DBT interventions in order to provide an extensive suit of approaches for a multicultural clientele. I am committed to cultural broaching and bringing social justice to therapeutic settings. My research interests include inquiring into the construct of uncanniness, prosocial behavior in relation to masking, and the evolution of psychological nosologies. As part of the lab I created Covid safe procedures to collect in-person behavioral data during the pandemic and created ethics and consent forms for the IRB. I am interested in graduate programs in clinical and counseling psychology that embrace multiple therapeutic approaches and which are multiculturally and LGBT+ oriented.</p>
